# CivicLens-Scroll-Animation

CivicLens is a **cinematic, scroll driven 3D web experience** designed to visually communicate civic problems, processes, and accountability in a modern and engaging way. The project uses **Three.js + GSAP ScrollTrigger** to create Apple-style camera choreography, smooth text transitions, and a premium storytelling flow.

This repository focuses on the **visual narrative layer** of CivicLens showing how civic issues emerge, are tracked, and get resolved through a single evolving 3D scene.
